# Checksum-Calculator
-Author: Yohan Hmaiti
-Developed a program to calculate 8/16/32 bit checksums of input gathered from the userâ€™s input file.

-The program take two command line parameters. The first parameter is the name
of the input file for calculating the checksum. The second parameter is the size of the
checksum (8, 16, or 32 bits). 

-The program generates output to the console (the terminal).

To Compile: 
 gcc -o programfilename programfilename.c

To Execute: 
 c -> ./pa02 inputfilename.txt sizechosen
 
=> inputFilename.txt is the text file and sizechosen is the checksum size in bits
 (Options are: 8, 16, & 32)

=> All input files are 8 bit ASCII 

Tools: (File I/O, Bitwise Operators, Checksum)
